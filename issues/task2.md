# Task 2: Project board

Please explore the **Projects** tab. As the **Project Manager**, here is what you need to do:

* Note: Use the Project without "beta", that is a board not a table!

1. Create a new project board (with any name), and use the **Basic Kanban** template, containing *"To do"*, *"In Progress"*, and *"Done"*
2. Set up these **Automations**:
	- When pull requests are newly added, put the item in "In progress"
	- When issues are closed, put the item in "Done"
	- When pull requests are merged, put the item in "Done"
3. Add all the current issues to "To do" or appropriately in other columns
4. From time to time, visit the **Issues** and **Pull requests** tabs to make sure all items are marked with your project board
5. Keep reminding people to tag their pull requests under your Project, and add their "hello" card
